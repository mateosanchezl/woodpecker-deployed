The Woodpecker Method is one of the best ways to improve your chess tactics — but only if you use it correctly. After watching thousands of players train on Peck, we've identified the five most common mistakes that hold people back.

## 1. Choosing Puzzles That Are Too Hard

This is the number one mistake. Players pick puzzles at or above their rating, then struggle through each one. The result? Slow cycles, frustration, and no pattern recognition.

**The fix:** Choose puzzles **100–200 points below** your puzzle rating. The goal is _speed and recognition_, not struggle. You should be able to solve most puzzles correctly — the magic happens when you solve them _faster_ each cycle.

<Callout type="warning" title="Common trap">
  If your first cycle takes more than 90 minutes for a 150-puzzle set, your
  puzzles are probably too hard. Drop the rating range and try again.

## 2. Making Your Set Too Large

A 500-puzzle set sounds impressive, but if it takes 3 hours to complete a cycle, you'll burn out before cycle 3. The Woodpecker Method's power comes from **completing many cycles**, not from having a huge set.

**The fix:** Start with **100–200 puzzles**. You can always create a new, larger set after mastering your first one. The sweet spot for most players is a first-cycle time of **30–60 minutes**.

## 3. Skipping Cycles When You "Know" the Answer

Some players complete 2–3 cycles and think, "I already know these puzzles, time for new ones." This is exactly the wrong instinct. The Woodpecker Method works because of **over-learning** — pushing past familiarity into automaticity.

**The fix:** Complete at least **4–5 full cycles** before moving on. Your cycle time should plateau before you consider the set "mastered." On Peck, you can track this in your progress analytics.

## 4. Training Inconsistently

Doing one massive session per week is far less effective than short daily sessions. Pattern recognition is built through **frequent exposure**, not marathon sessions.

**The fix:** Train for **15–30 minutes, 4–5 days per week**. Peck's streak system is designed to help with this — maintaining your daily streak keeps you accountable.

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro tip">
  Set a daily reminder. Most successful Peck users train at the same time each
  day — morning coffee and puzzles is a popular combination.

## 5. Not Reviewing Problem Puzzles

Every set has a few puzzles you consistently get wrong or spend too much time on. Ignoring these means you're missing your weakest tactical patterns.

**The fix:** After each cycle, review your slowest and most-missed puzzles. On Peck, the progress page highlights your **problem puzzles** so you can study them specifically. Ask yourself: _What tactical motif am I missing? Why don't I see it?_

## The Right Approach

Here's what effective Woodpecker Method training looks like:

| Aspect        | Wrong                  | Right                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Puzzle rating | At or above your level | 100–200 below your level |
| Set size      | 500+ puzzles           | 100–200 puzzles          |
| Cycles        | Stop at 2–3            | Complete 4–5+            |
| Frequency     | 1 long session/week    | 15–30 min daily          |
| Review        | Skip problem puzzles   | Study weakest patterns   |

## Start Training the Right Way

The Woodpecker Method is simple — but the details matter. By avoiding these five mistakes, you'll see faster improvement and build lasting tactical skills.
